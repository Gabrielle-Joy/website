	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<img class="about_img" src="images/ygOutDec29.jpg">

	<p>My name is Gabrielle Joy Higgins. I am currently a second-year univerity student at the University of the West Indies Mona. My major used to be Biochemistry but recently I switched over to Computer Science. Although I love the content in both fields, I prefer the practical side of Computer Science more. The courseload was too much for me to do both so I what I enjoyed more. When I was in high school I thought I had to choose exactly what i would be doing in life right then and there and stick to it. And even now sometimes I feel frustrated when I don't know exactly what I'm going to do. But it's better to do your best at what you love doing the most right now. Then your skills will bring you to different interests and opportunites that may lead you on a path you wouldn't have been able to dream up on your own.</p>
